DISCO:
- If BubbleSort is coded so it finishes sorting after a full pass without swaps, the  least amount of passes needed is one and the max is n-1. If BubbleSorted is coded without this function, the least and greatest amount of passes needed would be equal (n-1).

QCC:
- Is there a concrete definition for run-time complexity in this situation? 

BUB-QA:
q0: If a pass requires no swaps, what do you know?
a0: It is fully sorted.
q1: After pass p, what do you know?
a2: The elements at indeces 0 to p are sorted (if the number of passes begins at 0).
q2: How many passes are necessary to completely sort?
a2: no more than length-1

SEL-QA:
q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
a0: n
q1: What do you know after pass p?
a1: The elements at indeces (n-1)-p to n-1 are sorted (if the number of passes begins at 0).
q2: How do you know if sorted?
q3: if a pass for 2 elements has been completed
q3: What does a pass boil down to?
a3: exclude the previous sorted elements from the list, linear search for the new maximum, swap the maximum to the rightmost position amongst the unsorted elements

INS-QA:
q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
a0: n-1
q1: What do you know after pass p?
a1: The elements up to and including index p are sorted.
q2: How will you know when sorted?
a2: when the partition is at the end of the list
q3: What constitutes a pass?
a3: The partition is moved to the right and the element now directly to the left of the partition is walked to its place.
q4: What must you track?
a4: the location of the partition
